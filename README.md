# Coming Soon Page

## Overview

This sub-project is the prequel to the main project of building the entire portfolio website.

After buying the domain name (`longnguyen.ca`), I routed the nameservers (NS) to my hosting provider. Once it's done, the website was live.

However, when anyone enters my domain site, they will only see the default Welcome page made by the hosting provider.

Instead of that, I wanted to create my own Coming Soon page, which helps to let the visitors know that the website is legit and will be available soon.

This project also helps me brush up on my basic web development skills.

## Tech Stack

## Features

- Single page.
