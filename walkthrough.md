# Project Walkthrough

Here below are the steps and thought processes that I did during making this project.

## Define the Requirements

### Q: What is the purpose of this website?

- Inform the visitors that the website is under construction and will be available soon.

### Q: What are technical requirements?

- Single page.
- Clean, simple, neat looking.
- Responsive (desktop/mobile).

### Who are target audiences?

- Any general visitors.

## Design Layout

I created a layout wireframe of my landing page. The layout will show the placement of elements like the headline, sub-title, social media links, countdown timer or progress bar.

:fire: **Tip:** You can draw layouts by handwriting or use wireframing tools like Figma, Excalidraw, Sketch, Justinmind, Moqups. I used Excalidraw for this project since I love its hand-drawn style.
