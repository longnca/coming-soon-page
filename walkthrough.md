# Project Walkthrough

Below are the steps and thought processes I did while making this project.

## 1. Define the Requirements

### Q: What is the purpose of this website?

- Inform the visitors that the website is under construction and will be available soon.

### Q: What are the technical requirements?

- Single page.
- Clean, simple, neat looking.
- Having a progress bar to show the progress and remaining time before the launch day.
- Having a countdown timer.
- Responsive.
- Color theme: modern but moody, earthy tone.

### Who are target audiences?

- Any general visitors.

## 2. Design Layout

I created a layout wireframe for my landing page. The layout will show the placement of elements like the title, sub-title, social media icons, countdown timer and/or progress bar.

:fire: **Tip:** You can draw layouts by handwriting or use wireframing tools like Figma, Excalidraw, Sketch, Justinmind, Moqups, etc. I used Excalidraw for this project since I love its hand-drawn style.
