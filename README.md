# 'Coming Soon' page built with HTML & CSS

## Overview

This sub-project is the prequel to the main project of building the entire portfolio website.

After buying the domain name (`longnguyen.ca`), I routed the nameservers (NS) to my hosting provider. Once it was done, the website was live.

However, when anyone enters my domain site, they will only see the default Welcome page made by the hosting provider.

Instead, I wanted to create my own 'Coming Soon' page, which helps let the visitors know that the website is legit and will be available soon.

This project also helps me brush up on my basic web development skills. Check out my [write-up](./walkthrough.md) here!

## Tech Stack

The single web page is made using only **HTML** and **CSS** with a countdown timer and a progress bar built with **JavaScript**.

- Single page.
- Clean, simple, neat looking.
- Having a progress bar to show the progress and remaining time before the launch day.
